# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 - PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to compare PyBer metrics based on the city type. Currently the company has presence in three major areas with the unequal marker share:
1. Rural
2. Suburban
3. Urban



## Results

We looked at the data by summarizing some key metrics on the market/city type level.

•	Rural areas tend to have lower ridership, and hence lower fares collections. This as results leads to higher cost-per-ride/driver
•	The higher the population density, the more demand we see in ride-sharing services.
•	More rides generally lead to lower average cost.

## Summary

Based on the data and received results, we can recommend:

1.	Collect more information directly from the regional managers. They will have the best and most accurate input at what’s driving specific trends, any potentials or issues.

2.	Increase participating drivers’ presence in rural areas. Not having enough drivers, potentially leads to fewer rides, less fare collection, and as a result higher average fare per ride/driver.

3.	Increase presence at strong-performing market and invest in more advertising/marketing in those specific areas. It looks like city type has direct correlation with the ride-sharing demand and popularity. Urban areas generally have fewer people that have cars, which leads to higher ride-sharing demand. Higher service demand as result leads to lower average fares per ride/driver.
