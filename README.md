# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 - PyBer with Matplotlib

 
## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to compare PyBer metrics based on the city type. Currently PyBer has presence in three major areas with the unequal and disproportional marker share:
1. Rural
2. Suburban
3. Urban



## Results

We looked at the data by summarizing some key metrics on the market/city type level.

* Rural areas tend to have lower ridership, hence, lower fares collections. As a result, this leads to higher cost-per-ride/driver.

* The higher the population density, the more demand we see in ride-sharing services. This could be explained by the fact that urban areas generally have fewer people that have cars, which leads to higher ride-sharing demand. 

* More rides/higher service demand generally lead to lower average fare cost per ride/driver.

## Summary

Based on the data and received results, we can recommend:

1.	Collect more information directly from the regional managers. They will have the best and most accurate input at what’s driving specific trends and any potentials or issues.

2.	Increase participating drivers’ presence in rural areas. Not having enough drivers, potentially leads to fewer rides, less fare collection, and as a result, higher average fare per ride/driver.

3.	Increase presence in stronger-performing markets and invest in more advertising/marketing in those specific areas to potentially drive even mpore demand. The city type has a direct correlation with the ride-sharing demand and popularity.
